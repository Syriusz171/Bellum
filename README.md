# Bellum Proelium Devicta Tributum
The world's worst turn-based strategy game!  
## **WARMING**  
The game is <ins>**not**</ins> completed!  
It will be playable soon (or never)!   
Requires Python and Pygame to be installed on your computer!
### Game modes:  
- One computer multiplayer
  - Play on one computer with your friend (or someone else)!
- More gamemodes (fight with bots etc) will be avalitable one day (if I do not run out of patiance [SPOILER: I will])
  
The game is about founding villages and conscripting armies(soon) and fighting using them!  
### Known issues  
- multi-army movement (and yes, it DOES excist) works badly when one army moves onto the tile where was another moving army  
### Plans (or rather dreams of mine):
- Consription of armies (partially done but not completed)
- Mode to fight bots (a dream)
- Water and water transport (another dream)
- Alpine units (would be able to move thought mountains),(maybe?)
- More resourses like army-specific supplies, salt, stone etc(have to be done, right? Right?)
- Local resourses (that is resourses being stored in villages) and resourse trasport system(i guess it is a dream)
- Unit upkeep (armies would need to be moved with supplies (dream)
- No negative resourses (surprise! it is <ins>**not**</ins> a dream)
### Translations
I **WILL NOT** translate this game to other languages (except for Polish since I speak Polish)!  
But if you want to add translation for your language, you are welcome!
